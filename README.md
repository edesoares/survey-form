# freeCodeCamp's Survey Form
Moving on with the Responsive Web Design Certification. I've decided to make this survey form based on another project I've made weeks ago, so it's a survey form page for an e-commerce website specialized on buying and selling used UFOs.

I think I should try not to look at their example page next time.
Anyway, the page is hosted [here](https://codepen.io/edesoares/full/eYWPvxq).
